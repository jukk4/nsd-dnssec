some solutions/hacks for problems I encountered while using DNSSEC with [1]nsd/[2]ldns

problem:
	DNSSEC bootstrapping, key rollovers, zone signing etc. need quite some
	typing and waiting when done manually.
	
solution:
	sbin/nsd-dnssec				helper script for these tasks

	other helper scripts, intended to be run periodically:

	sbin/nsd-dnssec-process			list, start and resume
						processes like key rollovers
						for multiple zones at once
	sbin/nsd-dnssec-zonesigner		sign zones whose RRSIGs would
						expire soon


problem:
	Being able to increment a zone's SOA serial non-interactively is useful
	during DNSSEC processes, and needs to be done as an atomic operation
	together with e.g. the signing of a zone.

solution:
	bin/zonefile_soa-serial-increment.sh	increments the SOA serial
	sbin/nsd-dnssec				does the locking

	to be used implicitly during
	$ nsd-dnssec $zone signzone
	or explicitly as
	$ nsd-dnssec $zone soa_serial_inc


problem:
	$INCLUDE control entries in zone files (as defined in RFC 1035) are
	supported by nsd but not by ldns (and thus not by e.g. ldns-signzone(1)).

solution:
	bin/ldns-signzone_includes		ldns-signzone(1) wrapper which
						handles $INCLUDE control entries
	sbin/nsd-dnssec				does the locking

	to be used implicitly during
	$ nsd-dnssec $zone signzone
